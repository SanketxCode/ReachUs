 Compliance with NPCI Guidelines
National Payments Corporation of India (‚ÄòNPCI‚Äô) is an authorized payment system operator by the Reserve Bank of India (‚ÄòRBI‚Äô).
NPCI owns and operates UPI payment system. A Payment Service Provider (‚ÄòPSP‚Äô) is the banking company authorized to act as a Payment Service Provider under the UPI framework.
PSP engages the Third Party Application Provider (‚ÄòTPAP‚Äô) to provide UPI services to You/User.
A TPAP is an entity that provides the UPI compliant app(s) to the end-user customers to facilitate UPI based payment transactions.
The Bank where the end-user customer maintains his/her account and has linked the account for the purpose of debiting/crediting the payment transactions made through UPI is the Customers Bank. The end user customer is the individual who uses UPI payment facility to send and receive payments.
We, ReachUS Technologies Private Limited are a TPAP authorized by NPCI to facilitate payments through Axis Bank. We are a service provider and we participate in UPI through PSP bank.
We are bound by the tripartite agreement entered with the sponsor PSP (Axis Bank) and NPCI. We are responsible for facilitating grievances / complaints resolution of the customers on-boarded on our UPI application.
We shall be the first point of contact for all UPI related grievances/complaints for customers on-boarded by us. In case the complaint/grievance remains unresolved, the next level for escalation will be the PSP Bank, followed by the bank (where you maintain the account) and NPCI in the same order. After exercising these options, you can approach the Banking Ombudsman and/or the Ombudsman for Digital Complaints, as the case may be.
